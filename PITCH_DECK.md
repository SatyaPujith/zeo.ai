## 📊 SLIDE 2: The Problem

# 1 Billion People Need Help

### The Mental Health Crisis

```
🌍 1 Billion+     people with mental health disorders
😔 70%            avoid seeking help (stigma, cost, access)
💰 $100-300       cost per therapy session
⏰ Weeks-Months   wait time for appointments
📱 93%            of emotion is non-verbal (missed by text AI)
```

### Current Solutions Fail

❌ Traditional therapy: Expensive, limited hours, long waits  
❌ AI chatbots: Text-only, miss emotional cues, lack empathy  
❌ Crisis hotlines: Overwhelmed, not preventive
